DHTML Lemmings
==============

This repository is an updated version with a PWA manifest for the mobile web in 2024.

It is forked from repository an updated version that made use of newer technologies and adapt to the web in 2014.

That version added support newer devices like mobile phones or tablets using:

* HTML5 - avoid bad practices and use new standarized ones
* Touch Events and scrollable panels
* OGG music (insted of MIDI) - using web audio apis
* Responsive design (adapts from small to big screens)
* Avoid filtering images for pixel-perfect graphics
* CSP compliant (still far from this point)
* Smaller size (Compress code and music as much as possible)
* Better load times

The game is working but there's still lot of room for improvementso
